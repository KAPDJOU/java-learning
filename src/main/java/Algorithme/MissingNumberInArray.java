 * Questions d'entretien d'embauche Array having list of interger, from 1 to
 * 100. One number is missing. You have to find missing number and its index. My
 * Answer: We will calculate sum of integers present in array lets say Sum, and
 * we will calculate sum of number from 1 to 100 using x = n(n+1)/2. then x-Sum
 * will give you the missing number. He said I am just telling him the formula n
 * blah blah. Finally i asked his answer His Answer: Funny one. We will have a
 * for loop, for(i=1; i&amp;amp;lt;100; i++){ if(a[i] == null) //print i and
 * a[i]; } lolz... please anybody tell me how this logic can output your missing
 * number. And if u know null is the number, then why are you looping and making
 * it o(n) complexity. I think he googled the interview question, but not the
 * answers or approach :P
